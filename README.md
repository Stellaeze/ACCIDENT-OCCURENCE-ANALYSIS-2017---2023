The analysis revealed significant patterns and trends that highlight the primary causes of these road accidents and eventual deaths over the years. These observations provide valuble insight into the impact of factors such as adverse weather conditions, specific accident causes and hazardous road types on death tolls. 

 

The sum of deaths recorded on simple roads has been observed to top the chart when compared with the other road types. Clear sky has also shown to be at the top of charts for deaths that occured or are caused by weather conditions.
Secondly, the accidents recorded through the types of accident also has run - off topping the chart and is directly linked to simple roads that basically have no road demarcations, dividers, protectors/bridges and less of traffic regulatory bodies as they are often overlooked as less traffic congested areas and these could increase the risk of occurence of accidents despite the clear sky as recorded.
Also observed is the fact that there has been a significant and steady reduction in the occurence of accidents and deaths as recorded in the data. 
Accidents and death peaked in 2017 with a record of 404 and 315 respectivelyand a continuous reduction or drop in the records in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and with neither accidents nor deaths recorded in 20123 which indicates that there may have been improvemnts in safety measures and safety awareness to the public and everyday usuers. 
 

By identifying these critical areas, the dashboard offers a foundation for developing actionable recommendations aimed at mitigating accidents, reducing fatalities, and improving overall road safety which are a follows;

 

Safety improvemnts on simple roads should be a priority to reduce the risks of fatal accidents and save lives. Measures like speed bumps at short distances to automatically reduce speeding vehicles, guardrails to reduce road runoffs.
Regualr maintenance at intervals should also be implemented to address hazards on these simple roads especially in regions with hiogher accident occurrences.
It would also be recommended that whatever contributed to improvemnts of the road conditions that led to the decline of these accidents and eventual death after the year 2017 are maintained and improved upon consistently
These policies and practices can also be documented as a measure for future take - on and records.
Apply post 2017 successful procedures to other roads that might not be in the records but have high chances or records of high occurences of fatal accidents.
